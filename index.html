<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<h3>For the Cake:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>200 g</strong> Self-Raising Flour</li>
    <li><strong>200 g</strong> Butter <strong>at room temperature</strong></li>
    <li><strong>150 g</strong> Sugar</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong> Eggs</li>
    <li><strong>1 Tsp </strong>Baking Powder</li>
    <li><strong>Pinch</strong> of Salt</li>
    <li><strong>50 ml</strong> Milk</li>
    <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> Vanilla Essence</li>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>For the Icing:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>200 g</strong> Icing Sugar</li>
    <li><strong>80 g</strong> Butter</li>
    <li><strong>½</strong> Sprinkles</li>
    <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> Vanilla Essence</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix together the butter and sugar, ideally using an electric whisk</li>
    <li>Add the eggs and continue to whisk</li>
    <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
    <li>Sift in the flour, baking powder, and salt. Fold in gently.</li>
    <li>Add the milk and vanilla essence. Mix until well combined.</li>
    <li>Spread the mixture evenly into a lightly greased baking tray. I personally use a 30cm by 20cm baking tray, but any size will work great as long as it has space to rise</li>
    <li>Place into oven for 25 mins at 180°C. You can extend this time as necessary until a toothpick comes out clean, as dependent on the size of your baking tray it may take longer/less time to cook</li>
    <li>Prepare the icing by mixing together all of the ingredients</li>
    <li>Evenly spread the icing over the caking after allowing it some time to cool (ideally 20 minutes)</li>
    <li>Cover in sprinkles, and enjoy</li>
   
    
    
</ol>
<h2>Notes:</h2>
    
<ul>
    <li>Best served with Custard</li>
    <li>If you only have Plain Flour, then use 200g Plain Flour, and also add in 2 Tsp Baking Powder & ½ Tsp Salt</li>
    <li>I used a 30cm x 20cm baking tray, but other sizes will work fine too. Just ensure it’s fully cooked before removing</li>
    <li>Recipe works best with Unsalted Butter</li>
    <li>I like my icing thick so I make buttercream, but you can just exclude the butter to make it runny – you can also add more milk to make it more runny</li>
    <li>Allow cake to cool for a minimum of 20 mins before adding icinr</li>
    
</ul>
